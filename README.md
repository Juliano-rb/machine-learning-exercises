# Machine Learning Exercises
Some college works done while attending the machine learning discipline.

# Algorithms
<h3>Classification</h3>
<p>Uses <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification">Mushroom Classification</a> dataset. The goal is to predict if a mushroom is edible or poisonous. The main conclusion was that the dataset can be a lot optimized, since just some atributes are descriptive enough to know whether a mushroom is poisonous or not.</p>

<h3>Clustering</h3>
<p>Uses <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine">Wine Data Set</a> dataset. The goal was to cluster wine instances and compare if clusters generated are simular to the main classes purposed by the dataset, extracting any hidden information about the dataset.</p>
